## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- box shadow
- div with grey background and opacity for greyed website effect
- learned more VS CODE shortcuts


### What I learned

(Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.)

- I learned on how to greyed out a website, by using an abosute positioned div with bg color and opacity
- I reinforced my JS skill on onclick function, if statement and create variable with get element by ID and class
- First time using CSS custom properties to improve the readability of my code.



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="greyed"></div>
```
```css
.greyed{
display:none;
width:120px;
height:750px;
position: absolute;
background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
opacity: 0.7;
}
:root{
--font_normal:500;
--font_heavy:700;
--Almost_White: hsl(0, 0%, 98%);
--Medium_Gray: hsl(0, 0%, 41%);
--Almost_Black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
--h1_font_size:2.2rem;
--body_font_size:1rem;
--smaller_body_font_size:0.90rem;
--desktop_container_width:1000px;
--desktop_h1_font_size:4.8rem;
--mobile_width:375px;
}


### Continued development

-I would like to learn a faster way to code since it tooks me more than 6 hours to finish this.
-I would like to learn more on responsive website, so that my image and text will be more responsive as the width getting bigger



(Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.)
